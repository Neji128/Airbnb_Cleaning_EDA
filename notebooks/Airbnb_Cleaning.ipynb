      "Oud West is close to the city-centre and close to both Vondelpark and Rembrandtpark. Ten Katestraat market is an excellent outdoor market with its charming cross-street ‘Bellamystraat’ giving the area an old-fashion village vibe – complete with dance studio and blacksmith. Kinkerstraat is a multicultural area with a large shopping street filled with bars, restaurants, clothes etc. It’s criss-crossed with commercial streets, including Overtoom which has become a major interiors boulevard. Two of the city’s more interesting alternative cultural complexes, OT301 and Lab111, which both mix music, film and art, are located here. But for a real taste for the relaxed diversity of this neighbourhood, visit the sprawling terrace of Du Cap to truly witness all walks of life.

      "Dappermarkt is one of the country’s oldest - and best - outdoor markets. It forms the multicultural heart of the neighbourhood along with such major arteries as Javastraat, which once only provided every manner of global grocery but is now beginning to feature more upscale cafes and terraces. One of the city’s largest general hospitals, OLVG, is also located here. Two stellar city parks, Oosterpark and Flevopark, provide quick escape from the relatively busy streets. Besides many cheap ethnic eateries and supermarkets, the area is attracting much more higher-end cafes and restaurants who are often re-inventing many of the area’s industrial monuments.

      "De Pijp is vibrant and very much on its way up. As can be expected of an area that is centred on the nation’s most famous outdoor market: Albert Cuypmarkt, near to the Heineken brewery. This Amsterdam neighbourhood is famously diverse with over 100 nationalities represented. While still the best neighbourhood to choose from a wide selection of ethnic food, more high-end bars and restaurants have come on the scene to service students and young professionals. Further east along De Pijp there is the Van Woustraat, a former fast food strip, there are now several of the city’s more highly regarded restaurants. But perhaps most representative of the area is Bazar, a former church on the Albert Cuypmarkt that has been reinvented as a funky North African café/restaurant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0.002342\n",

The neighborhood itself is host to plenty of fantastic bars and great eating establishments.  Make sure to visit the Foodhallen, a repurposed tram depot filled with street food vendors. Because Amsterdam West is so near to the city center, all things you’d want to see in Amsterdam, such as the Dam, and Leidse square in the city center, are just a 10 minute tram ride away.  The same goes for Museum Square, where you will find the ‘Rijkmuseum’, the Van Gogh museum, ‘het Stedelijk Museum’ (the city museum, where you’ll find modern art), while around the corner there you’ll find the Heineken Experience.

      "My name is Charles and I have been living abroad for about one-third of my life. I recently came back to Amsterdam from Tanzania and at the moment I work for a start-up which focusses on 100% green energie. In my spare time I make bikes and love to out in the nature. \\r\\n\\r\\nObviously I like traveling and my most favorite destination is without doubt Afrika, were I was raised as a little boy. Therefore I speak a little French. \\r\\n\\r\\nI live together with my nephew and two friends of mine. We decided to rent out one of our empty rooms since we could use some extra income to upgrade the house. We renovated the room ourselves and the bed and bookshelf is made by us. \\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore we do pay a lot of attention to the quality and hygiene of our house and we expect our guests to do so as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee you soon?!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.000083\n",

      "Hi!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy name is Maarten, I am 41 years young and i can be your host in Amsterdam! \\r\\n\\r\\nI love to travel, and visited all continents (except Antarctica) at least once. Often as a backpacker, but also in luxury resorts. I also love City trips and discover new places, cultures and meet new interesting people.\\r\\nDuring my travels i like to stay in hostels or stay with other Airbnb host.  It's just super fun and exciting to meet new people, learn about their culture and see how they live. My English is fluent, and im open and easy to communicate.\\r\\n\\r\\nI like cooking for friends, and good food and drink. A nice barbecue with friends in the beautiful Westerpark example, or to  take a boat to cruise on the canals of my beautiful city.\\r\\n\\r\\nI studied Hotel Management, and  hospitality is in my blood. I will do everything to make you feel at home in my house,and do my best to make your stay in my beautiful city as good as possible. On request i can offer different tours and activitys, please contact me for details.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note that it is only the bedroom of my own house where I live that you rent! The kitchen, bathroom and living room you share only with me. I will sleep on a mattress in a private corner of the living room. Staying my house is another experience than staying in a hotel. The house is alive and there is personal items are all over. Of course I make sure the house is clean, u can use everything you see. For this reason i normally accept reservations from people with at least one or more reviews from previous stays with Airbnb. As the apartment is not so big, I accept only bookings for max 2 people.\\r\\n\\r\\nRenting my space on Airbnb is really my hobby. I do this mostly  because i like to do so. Also to meet new people and keep my apartment clean and tidy at all times. This far all my guest loved the style of my house, the interior,  and the  location of my house. They all said they felt a little bit at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nDreams are only dreams when you wake up and make them real!\\r\\n\\r\\nIs my life motto, and means that I think we always have to keep trying to achieve our dreams ..\\r\\nI always like and respect everyone, until I have a good reason to dont. I always treat people with respect, and expect the same from others.\\r\\n\\r\\n For more information or any other request, feel free to contact me on AirBnB.\\r\\n\\r\\n I look forward to welcome you as my guest!\\r\\n\\r\\n     0.000083\n",
